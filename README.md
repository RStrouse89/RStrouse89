- 👋 Hi, I’m Rob Strouse (@RStrouse89)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all things! (What makes somehting tick and why does it do so in that way) Dabbling in coding, love to play videogames whenever I'm not busy. But always looking for a new family activity to engage in. Other hobbies include; rock climbing, hiking, hobby farming, and woodworking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on codewars
