- 👋 Hi, I’m Rob Strouse (@RStrouse89)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all things! (What is it that makes something tick and how does it do so) Dabbling in coding, love to play videogames whenever I'm not busy. But always looking for a new family activity to engage in. Other hobbies include; rock climbing, hiking, hobby farming, and woodworking.
- 🌱 Actively using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on codewars, and any fun project opportunities
